# E-cov-19-An-Online-COVID-19-Tracker
E-cov 19: An Online COVID-19 Tracker is a Java Maven project for web scrapping that fetches the country wise covid 19 data with the help of jsoup library and maven dependencies and provides the GUI via Java Swing
This code creates a GUI window with a text field for entering a country name, 3 labels displaying the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries from COVID-19 for the specified country, respectively, and a button to fetch the data. The data is scraped from the website "https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/" + country + "/" using JSoup's connect and get methods, where "country" is the input entered by the user. The specific data is selected using CSS selectors and then displayed on the labels. The fetchData() method is called when the user clicks the "Fetch Data" button, so the data is fetched and displayed only when requested by the user.
